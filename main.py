# Add a FAQ Section
with st.expander("Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)"):
    st.write("""
    **Q1: What data format is required for upload?**
    A1: Please upload CSV files following the format specified in the 'Getting the Dataset' section.

    **Q2: What models are used for prediction?**
    A2: The app employs several machine learning models including Random Forest, XGBoost, and Ridge Regression.

    **Q3: Can I use my own dataset?**
    A3: Yes, you can use your own dataset as long as it has the same columns as specified in the 'Getting the Dataset' section. If the columns are different, the code will not work correctly.

    **Q4: What should I do if my dataset has different columns?**
    A4: If your dataset has different columns, you will need to modify the code to handle those differences. Ensure that the column names and data types match the expected format for the prediction models to function correctly.

    **Q5: Is there a limit on the size of the dataset that can be uploaded?**
    A5: There is no strict limit, but very large datasets may slow down the app or cause it to time out, especially on free hosting services. It‚Äôs recommended to use datasets of manageable size for better performance.

    **Q6: How is the data processed once uploaded?**
    A6: Once the datasets are uploaded, the app performs data cleaning, including handling missing values and removing outliers. It then prepares the data for prediction by applying necessary transformations such as encoding categorical variables.

    **Q7: Can I visualize my dataset in the app?**
    A7: Yes, after uploading your dataset, you can explore it using the EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) section, which provides various visualizations and statistical summaries.

    **Q8: What if I encounter an error during prediction?**
    A8: If you encounter an error, first ensure that your dataset matches the expected format. If the issue persists, you may need to check the data types and column names. The error messages should help identify the specific problem.

    **Q9: How are outliers handled in the dataset?**
    A9: The app uses a combination of IQR (Interquartile Range) and Z-score methods to identify and remove outliers, ensuring that the predictions are not skewed by extreme values.

    **Q10: What are the key features used for predicting house prices?**
    A10: Key features include Overall Quality (OverallQual), Living Area (GrLivArea), Garage Capacity (GarageCars), and Year Built (YearBuilt), among others. These features are used by the models to make accurate predictions.
